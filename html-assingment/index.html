                I am Rasim Kutluhan Turkes and I was born In July 1<sup>st</sup> (aka Canada Day!) 2005. I am from Turkey and I used to live In Ankara, the capital city.<br>
                I like stuff about medieval things. The Cuman Mercenaries have such cool helmets, you should check them out when you have the chance! You won't get disappointed.
